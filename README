====================================

INSTALLATION:

Step 1: Edit config.h and modify for your system.  Defaults should be
        fine for most systems.  Then edit the Makefile and set the OPTIONS
        variable to match your system configuration.

Step 2: Type: make

Step 3: Copy the cgi binaries to you cgi directory.  For most sites
        running NCSA HTTPD you can just name them filename.cgi and
        place them in your ~/public_html directory.  Or you may need to
        put them in ~/public_html/cgi-bin.  Ask your system administrator
        how to run your own cgi programs on your system.

        ie.    cp *.cgi ~/public_html

Step 4: I'd recommend you run these scripts under your own user id as
        opposed to under the httpd user id.  To do this you must set 
        the setuid bit.  type:

               chmod u+s ~/public_html/php*.cgi

        It is possible to run without setuid, and on some systems
        paranoid admins have user directories on non setuid filesystems.
        The only thing to be aware of if you don't run setuid is that
        access restrictions will not be completely secure, and you will
        have a bit of a hassle editing the various log files this
        package generates.

Step 5: Check http://www.io.org/~rasmus for complete installation and
        configuration instructions.  (Yes, I am lazy.  I don't feel like
        typing everything out twice.)
        
        Even if you don't think you need help, you might want to check this
        URL anyway to check whether or not you have the latest version.
        The easiest way to check the current version is to enter this
        url into your browser:

        http://www.io.org/~rasmus/phpl.cgi?version

        You can of course do that to your own version of the phpl.cgi 
        binary to verify whether you have that version yet or not.

Step 6: This step is very optional.  But if you wish, subscribe to the
        PHP Mailing list by sending an e-mail message to:

        majordomo@kajen.malmo.se

        with the line:

        subscribe php-list your_email_address

        in the body of the message.  The subject line is ignored.
        This list will put you in touch with other people using the PHP
        Tools and it will be a good source of information once you get
        going.
